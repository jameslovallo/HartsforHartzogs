                <div id="storyImg1" class="storyImg"></div>
                <p><span class="storyTitle">Chapter 1</span>Andrew and Kaitlyn met in 2014 through their mutual friend, Kaylynn. Kaylynn invited some friends to go out to dinner for her birthday; but only Andrew and Kaitlyn were able to go. According to
                    Andrew, he wanted to ask Kaitlyn on a date after dinner but he could not since she was seeing someone else.
                </p>
                <div id="storyImg2" class="storyImg"></div>
                <p><span class="storyTitle">Chapter 2</span>Flash forward to August 2016, at Kaylynn's wedding. Andrew and Kaitlyn met again; and then proceeded to talk and dance during the whole reception. Kaitlyn mentioned that she was in need of volunteer
                    coaches for a youth soccer program she helped oversee in Detroit. A couple of days later, Andrew signed up. This then began a three month process of Andrew asking Kaitlyn. In December 2016, Kaitlyn finally agreed. (Finally!)</p>
                <div id="storyImg3" class="storyImg"></div>
                <p><span class="storyTitle">Chapter 3</span>Andrew and Kaitlyn proceeded to grow in Christ together, learn about one another, and support each other in their individual goals. The Lord began to reveal to them that spending their love together
                    was in His plan through going to church together, doing devotionals together, and praying together. During this time, Andrew got baptized at their church (Mack Avenue Community Church in Detroit).</p>
                <div id="storyImg4" class="storyImg"></div>
                <p><span class="storyTitle">Chapter 4</span>On February 25, 2018; Andrew asked Kaitlyn to marry him. Of course, she said yes! Now, as they prepare to start the life together in September 2018, Kaitlyn works in foster care and will begin studying
                    for her Clinical Master's in Social Work; and Andrew is about to finish tech school and is looking to start his career in heating and cooling. They plan to live on the Eastside of Detroit where their church is located. </p>
